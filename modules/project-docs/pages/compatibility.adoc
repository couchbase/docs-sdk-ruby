The Couchbase Ruby SDK supports MRI Ruby versions 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1.
// We follow list of supported versions at https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/


== Couchbase Version/SDK Version Matrix

Couchbase SDKs are tested against a variety of different environments to ensure both backward and forward compatibility with different versions of Couchbase Server.
The matrix below denotes the version of Couchbase Server, the version of the Ruby SDK and whether the SDK is:

* ✖ *Unsupported*: This combination is not tested, and is not within the scope of technical support if you have purchased a support agreement.
* ◎ *Compatible*: This combination has been tested previously, and should be compatible.
This combination is not recommended by our technical support organization.
It is best to upgrade either the SDK or the Couchbase version you are using.
* ✔ *Supported*:This combination is subject to ongoing quality assurance, and is fully supported by our technical support organization.

See the notes there for Support details.

=== Capella Compatibility

The Ruby SDK is fully compatible with Couchbase Capella, our fully-hosted database-as-a-service.
To make development easier, the SDK includes the Capella client certificate ready installed.

// TODO: Verify this with dev team (this has been copied over from Python, so best to double check that it is correct).
== Platform Compatibility

The Ruby SDK is built on top of the C++ SDK (not currently available separately), which is tested and supported on the following platforms:
