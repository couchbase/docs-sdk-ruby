{description}


The Couchbase Ruby SDK allows you to connect to a Couchbase database from Ruby.
The Ruby SDK includes high-performance native Ruby extensions to handle communicating to the cluster over Couchbase’s binary protocols.

Ruby SDK supports https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/[currently maintained Ruby versions], and recommends the latest stable version where possible (currently 3.3 as of January 2023.)

The Couchbase Ruby SDK supports MRI Ruby versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.


== Couchbase Version/SDK Version Matrix

Couchbase SDKs are tested against a variety of different environments to ensure both backward and forward compatibility with different versions of Couchbase Server.
The matrix below denotes the version of Couchbase Server, the version of the Ruby SDK and whether the SDK is:

* ✖ *Unsupported*: This combination is not tested, and is not within the scope of technical support if you have purchased a support agreement.
* ◎ *Compatible*: This combination has been tested previously, and should be compatible.
This combination is not recommended by our technical support organization.
It is best to upgrade either the SDK or the Couchbase version you are using.
* ✔ *Supported*:This combination is subject to ongoing quality assurance, and is fully supported by our technical support organization.

See the notes there for Support details.

=== Capella Compatibility

The Ruby SDK is fully compatible with Couchbase Capella, our fully-hosted database-as-a-service.
To make development easier, the SDK includes the Capella client certificate ready installed.

== Ruby Version Compatibility

The Couchbase Ruby SDK aims to support https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/[all supported versions] of Ruby.
The table below indicates the Ruby SDK version where support of a version of Ruby was added.
Ruby versions that have reached their https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/[End-of-Life date] are not supported.
