The Couchbase Ruby SDK integrates well with Ruby-on-Rails, particularly for use as a https://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#cache-stores[Rails Cache Store^].
To do so, add the following to your Rails application config:

[source,ruby]
----
config.cache_store = :couchbase_store, {
  connection_string: "couchbase://localhost",
  username: "app_cache_user",
  password: "s3cret",
  bucket: "app_cache"
}
----

An implementation of the Cache Store for Rails can be found in our https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-ruby-client/blob/master/lib/active_support/cache/couchbase_store.rb[Ruby client repo].

// Add in Sinatra after we use it in the Travel Sample App.
