{description}
The Document class and structure has been completely removed from the API, and the returned value is now `Result`.
Retry behaviour is more proactive, and lazy bootstrapping moves all error handling to a single place.

The Ruby 2.x Couchbase SDK was not generally available as a supported product, working across all services, so no migration guide is necessary here.
