Management operations in the Ruby SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:


== Creating and Removing Buckets

To create or delete a bucket, call the bucket manager with the `buckets` call on the cluster:

[source,ruby]
----
options = Cluster::ClusterOptions.new
options.authenticate("Administrator", "password")
cluster = Cluster.connect("couchbase://localhost", options)

manager = cluster.buckets

settings = Management::BucketSettings.new
settings.name = "travel-sample"
settings.ram_quota_mb = 100
settings.flush_enabled = true
manager.create_bucket(settings)
----

This class is also used to expose information about an existing bucket (`manager.get_bucket(String)`) or to update an
existing bucket (`manager.update_bucket(bucket_settings)`).

The default Collection & Default Scope will be used automatically.
