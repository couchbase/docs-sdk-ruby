WARNING: Although still maintained and supported for legacy use, Views date from the earliest days of Couchbase Server development, and as such are rarely the best choice over, say, xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[our Query service] for your application, see xref:concept-docs:data-services.adoc[our guide to choosing the right service].

== Querying Views

Once you have a view defined, it can be queried from the Ruby SDK by using the `view_query` method on a `Bucket` instance.

Here is an example:

[source,ruby]
----
include::example$views.rb[tag=simple]
----


== MetaData

The `meta_data` returned with the results can be used to show the total number of results, and various debug info:

[source,ruby]
----
include::example$views.rb[tag=meta]
----

For more details, see the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-ruby-client/Couchbase/Bucket/ViewMetaData.html[API reference].
